A simple and secure password manager that helps store passwords.
</h1>

<p align="center"> 
    <img width="600" align="center" src="Capture1.JPG" alt="demo"/>
</p>

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt passwords entered by user using AES 256
- Store passwords in an encrypted database using MySql
- Access passwords with a single master password
- Securely delete passwords from the database

## Installation

To use this password manager, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

To use this password manager, you need to have MySql from this [website] (https://www.mysql.com/downloads/). After installing you will need to configure the connection with the program in the installation process( setting the username (ex: root), password, which we will need to insert in main.py)
For more help regarding the installation process of MySql check this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c2fUOgZMmY) ( for windows 10).


## Usage

To start the password manager, run the following command:

python main.py


You will be prompted to create a master password to secure your passwords database. After that, you can use the menu options to encrypt, store, and access your passwords.

!!. This program has been tested only for windows 10. You may have problems with displaying the graphic interface depending on the system resolution. For its correct display, you can set the resolution of your system to 1920 x 1080 from the display settings.

## Future updates

Soon I will implement a way to provide the possibility for the user to generate passwords to increase his security.

I will also implement a function to provide an interface with all accounts and passwords in order to streamline the account search process.

Problems/Errors: The lambda ,, after function '' displays an error in the terminal due to the animation of the text (the animation is still executed in the mainloop even if the window has been destroyed). If anyone knows a way to fix it, they can leave me a message or contribute to this project. :)
