</p>

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt passwords entered by user using AES 256
- Store passwords in an encrypted database using MySql
- Access passwords with a single master password
- Securely delete passwords from the database

## Installation

To use this password manager, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

To use this password manager, you need to have MySql from this [website] (https://www.mysql.com/downloads/). After installing you will need to configure the connection with the program in the installation process( setting the username (ex: root), password, which we will need to insert in main.py)
For more help regarding the installation process of MySql check this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c2fUOgZMmY) ( for windows 10).


## Usage

To start the password manager, run the following command:

python main.py


You will be prompted to create a master password to secure your passwords database. After that, you can use the menu options to encrypt, store, and access your passwords.
